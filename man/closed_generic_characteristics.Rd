\arguments{
\item{analytic}{This is the analytic data set}

\item{constructs}{The constructs to run statistics from}

\item{names_vec}{The names of the constructs in the final visualization}

\item{filter_cols}{The columns to filter the the data by (for totals and missing counts)}

\item{titlecase}{Changes construct values to Title Case}

\item{splits}{Splits the constructs if they are lists like "test_one,test_two" into two rows then counts them}

\item{subcategory_constructs}{This allows a characteristic to have a construct as a sub category, 
must be empty or specify a subcategory construct (or NA) for each construct (length of constructs == length of subcategory_constructs)}

\description{
Visualizes basic count statistics for a number of constructs. Missing values are 
given the value "Missing."
